# Wine-quality-prediction




## Task
The objective is to develop a model for predicting the quality of a white wine using certain characteristics of the wine. The response variable, Y, is the wine quality score
and is an ordinal variable ranging from 1 to 3 where:\


1 = lower\
2 = medium\
3 = superior

The problem of predicting an ordinal variable is interesting because there are several ways to
approach it. The following article provides an interesting overview of the issue.



## Data

The data is comprised of 2000 observations and the input variables are based on physicochemical tests
